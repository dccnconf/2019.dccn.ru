      <h2 class="dccn-panel-subtitle mt-5">Abstract</h2>

      <p class="text-justify">Today, about 6.5 billion “things” are connected to the Internet. And while this sounds like a lot, still less than 1% of all the things, that are around us and could be connected, are really utilizing this opportunity. Hence, the question is why all these devices are not equipped with wireless connectivity? In some cases, they are either too remote, too inaccessible, or there is simply too many of them to make it economically viable. To mitigate this gap, promising communication technologies emerge, which have the potential to become enablers for true mass IoT market. In this talk, we provide a practical perspective on dominant Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWA) network technologies, while challenging them to fulfill the key requirements of (critical) industrial IoT applications. Later, we will focus primarily on the 3GPP Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology supporting low data rate massive connections, enhanced coverage, reduced cost and complexity, ultra-low power consumption, and flexible delay characteristics. Moreover, we will reveal our prototype design of the NB-IoT device and outline the architecture challenges as well as the configuration required on the side of a mobile operator to have NB-IoT communication ready to take off. Finally, we summarize the NB-IoT radio coverage as well energy efficiency results obtained during the extensive measurement campaigns undertaken within the long-term cooperation with our industrial partners.</p>
